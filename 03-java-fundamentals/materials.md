## Module 03 - Java Fundamentals

Within this module you will learn the basic of Java. What is Java, why it's good for here in EPAM? What is JRE and JDK, how to install one of them? What's an IDE and why it's recommended to use one instead of using a basic text editor, e.g. Notepad?

### Module material

#### Required training material:
* https://learn.epam.com/detailsPage?id=0c6f14d3-3b60-4fa6-95b9-efae8048ba62&source=EXTERNAL_COURSE --- Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure
* https://learn.epam.com/detailsPage?id=f0a6e79b-1ce7-4a75-a108-a0f77030bec1&source=EXTERNAL_COURSE --- Learning Java
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html --- Java keywords which are very important (not all of them will be covered within this module).
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html --- Official Java tutorial from Oracle.
    * Chapter "Language basics"
    * Chapter "Numbers and Strings"

#### Suggested knowledge pages:
* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm --- Good place if you want to read short bits about this or that. If Oracle's official tutorial site seems to be a little dry for you, it might be worth checking this page first, and then navigate to Oracle's official page if needed.
* https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMHUHR/%5BSZGD%5D+Code+guidelines+for+Java --- "Code guidelines for Java" EPAM Knowledge Base page about general naming and formatting conventions

#### Optional useful sites/tools:
* https://www.learnjavaonline.org/ --- You can run basic Java code at this page. There are a few modules here too which can give you some idea about how this or that works, how you should use 'if', arrays, etc.
* https://lightbot.com/ --- Game to learn programming logic

#### Optional (Pluralsight):
* https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-fundamentals-language/table-of-contents (Chapters 1-6)
* Note for chapter 6: creation and usage of custom classes will be covered in the next module, but it will be handy to know a bit about classes, and in chapter 6 methods and functions are mentioned, which will be covered in this very module.

#### By the end of this module you will know what these are, what they are for in Java:
* Variables: int, long, boolean, char, String, double
* Data types: primitives, non-primitives
* Math Operators: +, , -, *, /, %, i++, ++i, i--, <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
* Logical expressions: !, &&, ||
* Conditional Logic: if, if not, if else, ?:, switch: case / continue / break / default
* Loops: for, foreach, while, do while
* Arrays: [], [][], size
* Comments: //, /**/, /** Javadoc */
* Functions, methods: functions, methods, return, void
